In America, if you mess with people, they hit you with the bat. However, in Asia, they hit you with badminton racquet. Why? That’s because badminton is really popular in Asia. If you are on a vacation there, and you want to play football in a park, you either have to go very early or very late because most of the time you will see badminton players everywhere. That’s how popular badminton is in Asian countries. That’s where I came from, and obviously badminton is my most beloved sport.
